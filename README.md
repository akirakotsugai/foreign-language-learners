# Foreign Language Learners




This python program was made to scrap the language exchange website interpals.net for a college Data Structure assignment.
It collects all online users' basic information, such as the home country and age,
and tell us how many online people there are and the average age for each country.
From this data, the program can generate four quite interesting graphs:

- 30 most active countries
- Most active vs Least active countries
- Oldest online people vs Youngest online people
- Users' age from 0 to 110 in groups of tens

## Instalation on linux

```
sudo apt-get install python3
pip install bs4 lxml iso3166 matplotlib numpy
```
